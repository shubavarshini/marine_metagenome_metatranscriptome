# marine_metagenome_metatranscriptome
Here we study the environmental changes over a 15-month time period at the seasonally hypoxic Boknis Eck study site. We combined water column properties (0-28 m), fluxes from the seabed, in situ O2 consumption rates from the sediment-water interface as well as sedimentary sequential Fe extraction and porewater chemistry, sulfate reduction rates (SRR) and generated 16S rRNA gene amplicons (from RNA template) (down to 30 cm) from January 2022 to March 2023. Additionally, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses for surface sediments (0-1 cm) of February and March as well as early October and late October 2022 were conducted. The aim was to better understand the seasonal changes imprinting on sediments exposed to temporally O2-depleted waters. This can help to forecast future sedimentary feedback scenarios of likely prolonged deoxygenation events for timely development of monitoring and mitigation strategies.
